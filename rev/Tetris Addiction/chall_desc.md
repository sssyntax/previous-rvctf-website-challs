Bro my friend is seriously addicted to Tetris. He keeps on telling me that he'll stop, he'll quit but its even affecting his grades he's not even doing homework anymore. The other day he told me that he 'can turn anything to tetris' and that he has become 'one with the tetris gods'. ??? do I need to call IMH ??? (P.S use a Chromium-based browser for the game)
